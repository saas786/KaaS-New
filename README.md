# KaaS - Knowledge as a Service

Welcome to my personal knowledge base - **KaaS** or Knowledge as a Service.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge note-base structured loosely as a *[[Zettelkasten]]*, a collection of interlinked *[[Atomic Notes]]* about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.

## Roadmap

Currently I am persistently perusing and curating my 10,000+ various notes houses across various platforms and locations: I would say I am about **18%** complete in this endeavor.

## Where Next?

Check out the `Meta/` Folder for details about this Vault and its setup:

-   [[About]]
-   [[Publish Workflow]] _(MkDocs version only, not Obsidian Publish)_
-   [[Structure]]

The [[Changelog]] is also a good _Meta_ resource.

### Maps of Content

If this vault serves as my version of [[Building a Second Brain|a second brain]], then [[2-Areas/MOCs/_README|Maps of Content]] or _MOC's_ are the underlying [[Synapse|synapse]]'s connecting the neurotransmitters of the brain together to form a complex, structured system.

In other words MOC's serve as structural, index notes that list related [[Atomic Notes]] in a single location.

Some Maps of Content to consider are:

-   [[Development]]
-   [[Actuarial Science]]
-   [[Productivity]]

The others are still works in progress as I collect and curate more notes into the vault.
