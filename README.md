# KaaS - Knowledge as a Service

Welcome to my personal knowledge base - **KaaS** or Knowledge as a Service.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge note-base structured loosely as a *[Zettelkasten](Slipbox/Zettelkasten.md)*, a collection of interlinked *[Atomic Notes](Slipbox/Atomic%20Notes.md)* about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.

## Roadmap

Currently I am persistently perusing and curating my 10,000+ various notes houses across various platforms and locations: I would say I am about **18%** complete in this endeavor.

## Where Next?

Check out the `Meta/` Folder for details about this Vault and its setup:

* [About](Meta/About.md)
* [Publish Workflow](Meta/Publish%20Workflow.md) *(MkDocs version only, not Obsidian Publish)*
* [Structure](Meta/Structure.md)

The [Changelog](Changelog.md) is also a good *Meta* resource.

### Maps of Content

If this vault serves as my version of [a second brain](Slipbox/Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md), then *Maps of Content* or *MOC's* are the underlying [synapse](Reference/Dictionary/Synapse.md)'s connecting the neurotransmitters of the brain together to form a complex, structured system.

In other words MOC's serve as structural, index notes that list related [Atomic Notes](Slipbox/Atomic%20Notes.md) in a single location.

Some Maps of Content to consider are:

* [Development](MOCs/Development.md)
* [Actuarial Science](MOCs/Actuarial%20Science.md)
* [Productivity](MOCs/Productivity.md)

The others are still works in progress as I collect and curate more notes into the vault.

## Notes

- Note: Launch this vault directly via the **Obsidian URI Schema**: `obsidian://open?vault=KaaS`.
- Note: This repository has two main branches: [main]() and [develop](). The [main]() branch is a representation of the [develop]() branch, but with all obsidian wikilinks converted to GitHub markdown links for display on GitHub. The [develop]() branch mirrors what you work with while inside the Obsidian application.
- Note: Links are converted using the rust library [Obsidian-Export]().
