# Data Science Lifecycle

The Data Science Lifecycle Process is a set of prescriptive steps and best practices to enable data science teams to consistently deliver value. It includes issue templates for common data science work types, a branching strategy that fits the data science development flow, and prescriptive guidance on how to piece together all the various tools and workflows required to make data science work.
