# R Package - raw

*Source: [casact/raw_package: Data package for R actuarial workshops](https://github.com/casact/raw_package)*

Raw is a Data package for R actuarial workshops containing publicly available data of interest to non-life actuaries.

## About

In order to facilitate R instruction for actuaries, we have organized several sets of publicly available data of interest to non-life actuaries. In addition, we suggest a set of packages, which most practicing actuaries will use routinely. Finally, there is an R markdown skeleton for basic reserve analysis.

````R
install.packages("raw")
InstallSuggestions()
````
